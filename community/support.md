We have a community of hundreds of space enthusiasts.

We have set up a satellite research center in our institution just to get our community together. The center is fully equipied with equipments for the development of our cubesat.

Before participating in our communities, [please read our Code of Conduct](https://engineering.fb.com/codeofconduct/). We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and we expect that all community members adhere to the guidelines within.

## Stack Overflow {#stack-overflow}

Stack Overflow is a popular forum to ask code-level questions or if you're stuck with a specific error. Read through the [existing questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cubesat) tagged with **cubesat** or [ask your own](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=cubesat)!

## Discussion forums {#discussion-forums}

There are many online forums for discussion about cubesats design and development. If you have an answerable code-level question, Stack Overflow is usually a better fit, and if you have any questions related to cad models or analysis, ansys forum will be good.

- [Docusaurus online chat](https://discord.gg/hejWG94p) for help,contribution and suggestions 

## Feature requests {#feature-requests}

For new feature requests, you can create a post on our [feature requests board (Canny)](#), which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
